            <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <p>The goal of the game is to win <span id="round-num">0</span> <strong>rounds</strong> against your opponent.</p>

            <p>You <strong>win</strong> a round as soon as your score is <span id="score-diff">0</span> points higher than your opponent's score.</p>

            <p>You <strong>lose</strong> (and your opponent wins) a round when your snake <strong>collides</strong> with itself, the opponent's snake or one of the walls.</p>

            <p>You gain points by eating <strong>apples</strong> that randomly appear in the game area. To eat an apple the snake needs to <strong>run over</strong> it. When you eat an apple, the snake <strong>grows</strong> and the game speed <strong>increases</strong>.</p>

            <p>The red snake is controlled by the <strong>WASD</strong> keys, and the blue snake is controlled by the <strong>arrow keys</strong> on the keyboard.</p>
